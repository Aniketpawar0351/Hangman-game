        <h1>The Hangman Game</h1><br>
        <p>Developed a hangman game using Laravel, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and PHP.</p>
        <p>Implemented MySQL database integration to fetch random words for the game.</p>
        <p>Implemented game logic to allow users to guess the word with a maximum of six wrong guesses.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Tools and Technologies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Laravel</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>PHP</li>
            <li>MySQL</li>
        </ul>
        <br>    

        <p>Goal of Project:</p>
        <p>The goal of the hangman game project was to create an interactive and entertaining game where users can guess a word by selecting letters, with a limited number of wrong guesses allowed.</p>

        <p>Process:</p>
        <p>The project involved utilizing Laravel, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and PHP to develop the hangman game.</p>
        <p>The MySQL database was integrated to fetch random words for the game, providing a dynamic and diverse word selection for users.</p>
        <p>Game logic was implemented to track user input, validate guesses, update the game state, and determine the outcome based on the number of wrong guesses.</p>

        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interactive user interface with a visual representation of the hangman and the word to guess.</li>
            <li>Random word selection from the MySQL database, ensuring a unique and challenging experience for each game.</li>
            <li>Real-time feedback on correct and incorrect guesses through sound effects and visual cues.</li>
            <li>Restriction on the number of wrong guesses, adding a level of difficulty and excitement to the game.</li>
            <li>Play Again and Quit options, allowing users to restart the game or exit when desired.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Tools and Technologies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Laravel: Used as the framework to handle routing, database integration, and overall project structure.</li>
            <li>JavaScript: Implemented game logic, user input handling, and dynamic updates to the game interface.</li>
            <li>HTML: Created the structure and layout of the game interface.</li>
            <li>CSS: Styled the game interface to provide an engaging and visually appealing experience.</li>
            <li>PHP: Utilized PHP for server-side processing, database interactions, and dynamic content generation.</li>
            <li>MySQL: Integrated MySQL database to store and retrieve random words for the game.</li>
        </ul>
